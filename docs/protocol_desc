Each machine maintains a set of connected machines in the
network.

There should be a mechanism to keep these list synchronized
between machines.

Also each machine has it's own set of appointments stored
in an SQLite database.

Join Network:
    We assume that a machine S is always on the network.
    When a new machine N "joins" the network it should know
    the ip address of an already connected machine.
    It should send a HELLO message to S

    S should respond with a WELCOME message containing:
        - the set of the connected machines
        - a snapshot of the database


    When N receives the WELCOME message it should:

        1. create the set of the connected machines
        2. merges his database of appointments with the received.

    After that N should PROPAGATE the snapshot of his database to
    all machines.

    PROPAGATE should contain:
    flag init
    the changes of the database merged from WELCOME msg
    the ip of the machine

When a machine X receives a PROPAGATE message it should:
    1. Add the received IP in the set
    2. Merges the changes received with his local database

When a machine creates/modifies an appointment it should
send to all machines a PROPAGATE message with the changes

When a machine A wants to sign off the network it should send
a BYE message to any machine B.


When X receives a bye message  it should remove the B
from his set and notifying the remaining machines
by sending a MREM message to the remaining machines.

When the remaining machines receive the MREM message the
delete the specified machine from their sets.
